Hi. I want to make my website. I am an artist, so it should be really simple and minimalistic portfolio for now. I have plan how I want it to look, as well as the pages I need. Im using github. Can you help me to make a code?

Hi! I'd be happy to help you create a simple, minimalistic portfolio website.

Before I start coding, could you tell me a bit more about your vision?

What pages do you need? (e.g., Home, Gallery/Portfolio, About, Contact?)
What's your aesthetic preference? (e.g., black and white, lots of whitespace, specific color palette?)
How do you want to display your artwork? (e.g., grid layout, single column, slideshow?)
Any specific features? (e.g., image lightbox/zoom, contact form, links to social media?)
Do you want a single-page site or multiple HTML pages?
Once you share your plan, I'll create clean, minimal HTML/CSS code that you can easily upload to GitHub Pages!

Before I start answering that, is it possible to share a photo with you, just to show you the design

Yes, absolutely! You can share a photo with me. Just upload the image and I'll be able to see your design concept. That will help me understand exactly what you're looking for!

2 PROJECTS 400 px.jpg
This is a preview of one page

Perfect! I can see your design - it's beautifully minimal and clean. I can see:

Header: Your name "jovana radujko" on the left, with navigation links (about, projects, contact) where "projects" is underlined
Filter/Category system: Two rows of filter options (like "all", "brutalizm i renesansa", "genex 360", "churches", "collabs", "other" and "all", "monuments", "non-residential", "residential")
Grid layout: 3 columns of project images with captions below each
Light beige/cream background with black text
Very minimal, architectural aesthetic
A few questions to finalize the code:

How many pages total? Just the projects page shown, plus About and Contact pages?
For the filters - should they actually filter the projects when clicked, or are they just visual for now?
When you click a project image - should it open a larger view, link to a detail page, or do nothing for now?
Contact page - do you want a simple email link, a contact form, or just text with your contact info?
Do you have your actual project images ready, or should I use placeholder images you can replace later?
Let me know and I'll build this out for you!

I will write you the concept, but dont send me the code yet. Cos later we will go thorugh stuff like fonts, dimensions, colors, etc.

OK, so:

MAIN PAGE - here I want just the links jovana radujko, about, projects and contact, thats it. For background I will use a video of my animated drawing which I will make in adobe effects
ABOUT - here I want the same links jovana radujko, about, projects and contact. White background. One photo of myself aligned with the jovana radujko on the left. And text centrally (about me).
Perfect! I

I will write you the concept, but dont send me the code yet. Cos later we will go thorugh stuff like fonts, dimensions, colors, etc.
OK, so:
1. MAIN PAGE - here I want just the links jovana radujko, about, projects and contact, thats it. For background I will use a video of my animated drawing which I will make in adobe effects
2. ABOUT - here I want the same links jovana radujko, about, projects and contact. White background. One photo of myself aligned with the jovana radujko on the left. And text centrally (about me). On this page I will need a simple white footer with my name and all rights reserved and my signature (I will make it as a .jpg)
3. PROJECTS - here I want the same links jovana radujko, about, projects and contact. 
In projects section, I will need second and third menu with links.
projects will be in pictures (that will have lightbox with zoom and detailed descripiton)
Cathegories in second menu are: all, brutalism, maps, genex 360, churches and collabs
Cathegories in third menu appear when you click on brutalism: all, monuments, non-residential, residential (I hope this is clear!)
I need a footer for all of this pages, same as in about
4. CONTACT -  here I want the same links jovana radujko, about, projects and contact. 
Just simple text and links to my instagram and mail.

So, basically, I need super simple website, mostly white background and black letters.
Pages are: jovana radujko (main),
about,
projects/all, projects/brutalism/all, projects/maps, projects/genex360, projects/churches, projects/collabs; projects/brutalism/monuments, projects/brutalism/nonresidential, projects/brutalism/residential,
contact

I want the pictures to be in a row of 3, with lightbox option.

WHat do you think?

I think this is a great concept! Very clean and well-structured. Let me make sure I understand everything correctly:

Structure:

Main page: Just navigation links centered with video background
About: Photo aligned with your name on left, text centered, footer
Projects: Filterable gallery with nested categories (brutalism has subcategories), footer
Contact: Simple text with social links, footer
Key features I'm noting:

Navigation on all pages
Lightbox for project images with zoom and descriptions
Footer on About, Projects, and Contact pages
3-column grid for project images
White background, black text (except main page with video)
A few clarifications:

Main page navigation positioning - you said "just the links" - do you want them centered on the page, or in the header like the other pages?
Video on main page - should it loop continuously and autoplay?
Projects filtering - when someone clicks "brutalism" in the second menu, does the third menu appear below it? And when they select from the third menu, it filters the gallery?
"jovana radujko" link - should this always link back to the main page from any page?
Footer signature - you mentioned a .jpg signature - should this be next to "© jovana radujko all rights reserved" or below it?
Once we clarify these points, we can move on to fonts, exact spacing, colors, and dimensions!

Main page navigation - same placement like on the other pages. Just the font color is white (cos the video is dark)
Video on main page - yes, it will be like an animation, it should go on autoplay and loop (I havent finished it yet)
Projects filtering - Yes, when someone clicks brutalism third menu appears so you can filter through brutalism (all, monuments, non residential, residential)
Jovana Radujko link - I think its smart for this to be a link to the main page from all the pages?
Foother signature - I thought about maing the .jpg with text and my signature in handwriting. So we can put it as footer all together
Perfect! That all makes sense. So just to confirm the footer - it will be one .jpg image that contains both "© jovana radujko all rights reserved" (or similar text) AND your handwritten signature all in one image file. Got it!

Now let's talk about the design details:

FONTS:

What font do you want to use? (e.g., a specific Google Font, or just a simple sans-serif?)
Same font throughout, or different for headings vs body text?
NAVIGATION:

Font size for the navigation links?
Spacing between the links?
Should "jovana radujko" be bold or different in any way from the other links?
Underline style for active page (like "projects" in your screenshot) - just a simple underline?
LAYOUT & SPACING:

How much space from the top edge to the navigation?
For the About page - how wide should the centered text be?
For Projects page - spacing between the filter menus and the image grid?
Spacing between images in the grid?
COLORS:

Background: pure white (
#FFFFFF) or that beige/cream from your screenshot?
Text: pure black (
#000000)?
Any hover effects on links?
IMAGES:

What aspect ratio for project images? (square, landscape, portrait?)
Captions below images - what should they include? (title, year, brief description?)
Take your time - we can go through these one by one if it's easier!

I want to use MyriadPro Condensed and MyriadPro Condensed Bold.
For main menu: jovana radujko condensed bold, other things just condensed. Font 18px
For second and third menu: MyriadPro Condensed, 14px
For Captions of images MyriadPro Condensed Bold 14px

Spacing between links in main menu 36px
Spacing between links in smaller menus 28px

Just a simple underline for active link

From above to the navigation, space is 36px
Between first menu to the second 36px
Between second and third menu 28px

For about page - my photo will be 400px wide. 60 px spacing. 400px for the text. the text should be centered.

Spacing between menus and images should be 36px
Spacing between image and caption should be 28px. Spacing between caption and image under it should be 36px
Spacing between images should be 60px. 3 in a row, centrally, 400 px wide

I should stick with white background for now and black font

Images are prepared in 530x700px for lightbox. But for the grid its 400x528. Portrait (most of them, fixed dimension is 400 width)
Caption includes just the name of the drawing. Lightbox will contain more that about it.

Excellent! This is super clear and detailed. Let me recap to make sure I have everything:

FONTS:

Main menu: "jovana radujko" = MyriadPro Condensed Bold 18px, other links = MyriadPro Condensed 18px
Second/third menus: MyriadPro Condensed 14px
Image captions: MyriadPro Condensed Bold 14px
SPACING:

Top margin to navigation: 36px
Main menu links spacing: 36px between each
First menu to second menu: 36px
Second to third menu: 28px
Second/third menu links spacing: 28px between each
Menus to image grid: 36px
Between images horizontally: 60px
Image to caption below: 28px
Caption to next image below: 36px
ABOUT PAGE:

Photo: 400px wide, aligned left with "jovana radujko"
Gap between photo and text: 60px
Text width: 400px, centered on page
PROJECTS PAGE:

Images: 400px wide (height auto-scales to maintain aspect ratio)
3 columns, centered
Lightbox opens with 530x700px version + detailed description
COLORS:

White background (
#FFFFFF)
Black text (
#000000)
Main page: white text for navigation (dark video background)
A few final questions:

Hover effects - should links change color or get underlined when you hover over them?
Footer spacing - how much space above and below the footer image?
Lightbox description - what info do you want shown? (title, year, medium, detailed description?)
Main page - should the navigation be at the top like other pages, with the video filling the rest of the screen?
Then we're ready to code!

Im sorry, its 14px from drawing to caption, then 36px from caption to next image under**

Hover effects - goes mid gray when hover, when clicked- underline
Footer should be white line all over the bottom of the page, 36px height which will contain image with signature etc
Lightbox descrpition - Title, Location (cos I draw buildings), medium,.. few lines all in all
Main page - navigation should be in the same position as other pages
Perfect! Got it - let me confirm the updated spacing:

IMAGE SPACING (corrected):

Image to caption below: 14px
Caption to next image below: 36px
Between images horizontally: 60px
HOVER/ACTIVE STATES:

Hover: mid gray color
Active/clicked: underline
FOOTER:

White bar across bottom, 36px height
Contains your signature image centered
LIGHTBOX:

Title
Location
Medium
Brief description (few lines)
MAIN PAGE:

Navigation in same position as other pages (top, 36px from edge)
Video fills background
One small detail - for the mid gray hover color, what shade? Something like 
#666666 or 
#808080? Or I can just pick something that looks good?

Also, when the third menu appears (monuments, non-residential, residential), should "brutalism" stay underlined in the second menu to show it's selected?

After this we're ready to build! 🎨

(Lightbox - image centred, description in MyriadPro Condensed 16px, 60px from the picture on the right side - is this making sense ?)

For the hover, you can pick the color

Yes, brutalism should stay underlined.

Also, cos im making this all in github, that should be... 12 pages overall? for now

Yes, the lightbox description makes perfect sense! Image centered, description 60px to the right of the image in MyriadPro Condensed 16px. Clear! ✓

And yes, you're right about the pages! Let me list them out:

12 HTML pages:

index.html (main page with video)
about.html
contact.html
projects-all.html
projects-brutalism-all.html
projects-brutalism-monuments.html
projects-brutalism-nonresidential.html
projects-brutalism-residential.html
projects-maps.html
projects-genex360.html
projects-churches.html
projects-collabs.html
Plus you'll need:

CSS file(s)
JavaScript file for the lightbox functionality
Your images folder(s)
Footer signature image
Video file for main page
Does this structure work for you? Should I create the complete code now with all these pages set up? I'll include placeholder images that you can replace with your actual artwork, and comments in the code to show you where to add your video, images, and descriptions.

Ready when you are! 🚀

Ok. Should we go page by page for me to upload it one by one onto git?

That's a great approach! Going page by page will make it easier to test and troubleshoot as you upload to GitHub.

Let's start with the foundation and build up:

Suggested order:

First: CSS file + Main page (index.html) - This sets up your styles and the entry point to your site
About page - Simple page to test navigation
Contact page - Another simple one
One projects page (maybe projects-all.html) - Get the gallery and lightbox working
Then the rest of the project pages - Once one works, the others are just duplicates with different content
Does this order work for you?

Should I start with the CSS file and main page (index.html) first? That way you can upload both, add your video file, and see the navigation working right away.

Let me know and I'll create the first artifact! 🎨

I still dont have video, but you can leave the space for it in the code?
Lets do the index page (main page)

Perfect! I'll create the main page (index.html) with a placeholder for your video. The code will have clear comments showing you exactly where to add your video file when it's ready.

Portfolio - Main Page (index.html)
Interactive artifact 
Great! Now let me create the CSS file with all your specifications:

Portfolio - CSS (styles.css)
Code 
Perfect! I've created both files for you. Here's what you need to do:

To upload to GitHub:

Create a styles.css file with the CSS code
Create an index.html file with the HTML code
When you're ready to add your video:
Upload your video file to the repository
In index.html, replace your-video.mp4 with your actual video filename
About the fonts: The CSS is set up for MyriadPro Condensed, but you'll need to:

Create a fonts folder in your repository
Add the MyriadPro font files (.woff2 and .woff formats work best for web)
The code is already set up to load them
Test it: Once uploaded to GitHub Pages, you should see:

White navigation at the top (will turn white when video is added)
"jovana radujko" in bold
Links spaced 36px apart
Video background placeholder (black screen until you add video)
Does this look good? Ready to move on to the About page next?

one more question. should I make styles.css in same folder as index.html

Yes, exactly! Keep it simple - put styles.css in the same folder as index.html.

Your GitHub repository structure should look like this:

your-repository/
├── index.html
├── styles.css
├── about.html (we'll add this next)
├── contact.html (later)
├── projects-all.html (later)
├── fonts/
│   ├── MyriadPro-Condensed.woff2
│   └── MyriadPro-CondensedBold.woff2
├── images/
│   └── (your project images)
└── your-video.mp4 (when ready)
Since they're in the same folder, the link in the HTML (<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">) will work perfectly.

Once you upload both files to GitHub, let me know and we can move on to the About page! 🚀

Hmm. I cannot see anything. https://uponariverssky-source.github.io/jovanaradujko.com/index.html

Let me check the page for you to see what might be wrong.

favicon

Fetched Jovana Radujko
github.io

Good news - the page is loading! I can see the navigation text. The issue is that the CSS isn't loading properly, which is why you're seeing plain text instead of styled navigation.

Let me help troubleshoot:

Check if styles.css is uploaded - Go to your GitHub repository and make sure styles.css is there alongside index.html
Check the file path - In your repository, is the structure:
   jovanaradujko.com/
   ├── index.html
   └── styles.css
Wait for GitHub Pages to update - Sometimes it takes a few minutes for changes to appear
Can you check if styles.css is in your repository? If it is, try this URL to see if the CSS file is accessible: https://uponariverssky-source.github.io/jovanaradujko.com/styles.css

Let me know what you find and we'll fix it!

I think its about name of the font, assets/MyriadPro-Cond.woff2

Ah, perfect! So your font file is located at assets/MyriadPro-Cond.woff2. Let me update the CSS to use the correct path and filename:

Portfolio - CSS (styles.css)
Code ∙ Version 2 
Updated! Now it points to assets/MyriadPro-Cond.woff2 for both regular and bold.

Do you have separate files for bold? If you have:

assets/MyriadPro-Cond.woff2 (regular)
assets/MyriadPro-CondBold.woff2 (bold)
Let me know the exact bold filename and I'll update it. Or if the same file contains both weights, what we have now should work!

Update your styles.css file on GitHub with this new version and it should load the font correctly. 🎨

Capture.JPG
Perfect! I can see your file structure. You have:

MyriadPro-Cond.woff2 (regular)
MyriadPro-BoldCond.woff2 (bold)
Let me update the CSS with the correct filenames:

Portfolio - CSS (styles.css)
Code ∙ Version 3 
Great! Now it's pointing to the correct files:

Regular: assets/MyriadPro-Cond.woff2
Bold: assets/MyriadPro-BoldCond.woff2
Update your styles.css on GitHub and it should work now! The "jovana radujko" should appear in bold and all the navigation should be properly styled. Let me know once you've updated it! 🎨

Ok it works. should I put a black bacground for index page untill I make video

Yes, that's a great idea! A black background will match your dark video and make the white navigation visible.

Let me add that to the CSS:

Portfolio - CSS (styles.css)
Code ∙ Version 4 
Done! Now the main page will have a black background until you add your video. Update your styles.css and you should see the white navigation on a black background.

Ready to move on to the About page next? 🎨

one more thing. can the jovana radujko about etc
Be alligned exactly 660px from the center of the page

Yes! Let me update the navigation to be centered on the page with the first link starting 660px from the center:

Portfolio - CSS (styles.css)
Code ∙ Version 5 
Perfect! Now the navigation will start exactly 660px to the left of the center of the page. This will keep it consistently positioned across all screen sizes.

Update your styles.css and the navigation should be positioned exactly where you want it! ✨

Ok. Lets do about me page. I have prepared the footer .jpg and about me photo. For text I will put blablablabla for now

Perfect! Let's create the About page. I'll use placeholder text for now and you can replace it with your actual content later.

Portfolio - About Page (about.html)
Interactive artifact 
Great! Now you need to:

Upload about.html to your GitHub repository
Add your images:
Your about photo: put it in assets/images/ folder and name it about-photo.jpg (or update the filename in the HTML)
Your footer signature: put it in assets/ folder and name it footer-signature.jpg (or update the filename in the HTML)
Replace the placeholder text with your actual about content - just edit the <p> paragraphs
What the page will show:

Navigation at top (660px from center, "about" underlined)
Your photo on the left (400px wide, aligned with "jovana radujko")
Text on the right (400px wide, 60px gap from photo)
Footer at bottom with your signature image
Let me know once you upload it and if you need any adjustments! Ready to move to the Contact page after this? 🎨

I need the jovana radujko about project contact to be in the exact same place as on the index page.

I need the profile photo to be under links for 36px. 
Text should be in same row, centred

Got it! Let me update the about page layout:

Portfolio - CSS (styles.css)
Code ∙ Version 6 
Perfect! Now:

Navigation stays in the exact same position as index page (660px from center)
Photo is 36px below the navigation
Photo and text are centered on the page with 60px gap between them
Update your styles.css and the about page should be positioned correctly! ✨

Screenshot 139.png
Screenshot 140.png
its not good!
Look!

I see the issues! The navigation on the about page is not aligned with the index page, and the layout needs adjustment. Let me fix:

The navigation needs to be in the same position on both pages
The photo and text need better alignment
Portfolio - CSS (styles.css)
Code ∙ Version 7 
Now the photo will align exactly with "jovana radujko" on the left (660px from center), and the text will be 60px to the right of the photo. Both will start 36px below the navigation, perfectly aligned!

Update your styles.css and it should look much better! ✨

now i cannot see the navigation at all!

Oh no! The navigation is getting hidden. Let me fix that - the about container shouldn't be positioned absolutely:

Portfolio - CSS (styles.css)
Code ∙ Version 8 
Now it should work! The navigation is at the top (36px from top, 660px from center), and the about container starts 72px from top (36px + 36px spacing), aligned at 660px from center to match the navigation.

Update your styles.css and both the navigation and content should be visible and aligned! 🎨

one more thing. footer has a black line, i dont want it, just white

Let me remove that black border from the footer:

Portfolio - CSS (styles.css)
Code ∙ Version 9 
Done! The footer is now just white with no black line. Update your styles.css and it should look clean! ✨

It still has a black line! And I want footer to be over the images when people scroll?

Let me fix both issues - remove the border and increase the z-index so the footer stays on top when scrolling:

Portfolio - CSS (styles.css)
Code ∙ Version 10 
Updated! I've added border: none explicitly and z-index: 100 so the footer will stay on top when you scroll.

If you're still seeing a black line, it might be coming from your footer image itself. Can you check if the .jpg file has a black line in it? The CSS should now have no borders at all!

Update your styles.css and let me know if it's fixed! 🎨

sorry it was just a refresh problem.
What page should we do next?

Great! Glad it's working now.

Let's do the Contact page next - it should be quick and simple! Just the navigation, some text with your email and Instagram links, and the footer.

Ready to create it? 🎨

yes
for now,
lets put

text - instagram: brutalizam_i_renesansa (link: https://www.instagram.com/brutalizam_i_renesansa/)
instagram: jovana_radujko (leave place for link)
email: blabla

The text should be myriadpro condensed 18px
hover D3D3D3 color (for instagram 1 and 2)

Navigation bar same place as about and main page

text should be left aligned under the navigation, 108 px from the top

Perfect! Let me create the Contact page:

Portfolio - Contact Page (contact.html)
Interactive artifact 
Now let me add the CSS styling for the contact page:

Portfolio - CSS (styles.css)
Code 
Perfect! Now you have:

Navigation in the same position (660px from center)
"contact" is underlined as active
Text starts 108px from top, aligned with the navigation
Font size 18px MyriadPro Condensed
Instagram links hover to 
#D3D3D3
Email is just plain text (no link)
Footer at bottom
Upload `contac
